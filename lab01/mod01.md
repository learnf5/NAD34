# Completing a Hands-on Lab Exercise

After you've accessed the lab environment and logged into the workstation, follow these steps to complete lab exercises included in this course.

> [!Note] You do not have to complete any lab exercise in one session. At any time, you can save your work and return to resume the activity at a later time.

## Step 1: Locate and arrange the Lab Guide(s) for convenience during the lab activity.

1. Locate lab instructions (right pane) and navigate to step 1.

1. Arrange, size, or split the instruction window pane as desired.

1. Locate lab files on the desktop, if you have a folder there, and open it to see what's provided.

> [!Note] If your activity includes large amounts of text to be copied and pasted, for example into a console window, you might see a Lab Guide on the workstation desktop. Using this version of the guide, copy and paste functions work more directly than copying from the guide in the Instructions pane.

**What do you see?**

The instruction pane and desktop are arranged so you can easily read instructions and interact with applications in the lab.
